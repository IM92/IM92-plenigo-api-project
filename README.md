## Project Overview

The NASA EPIC Image Fetcher is a Java-based application designed to fetch and store images from NASA's EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) archive. It allows users to specify a date or fetch the latest available images, download them, and save them to a specified local directory.

## Key Components

### ImageShellCommand (Shell Component)
- Responsible for interacting with users via a command-line interface (CLI).
- Uses Spring Shell to define commands (`fetchEpicImages`) that users can execute to fetch and store images.

### ImageService (Service Layer)
- Provides business logic for fetching images based on the specified date.
- Utilizes `RestTemplate` for making HTTP requests to NASA's EPIC API.
- Handles image retrieval and saving functionality.

### ImageServiceImpl (Service Implementation)
- Implements the `ImageService` interface.
- Contains the core logic for fetching images from NASA's EPIC API based on the date provided.
- Utilizes `WebConstant` for API URLs and date formats.

### Image (Domain Object)
- Represents an image fetched from the EPIC API.
- Contains attributes such as `image` (identifier) and `date` (timestamp).

### WebConstant (Configuration)
- Holds constants such as API URLs (`EPIC_FETCH_IMAGES_BY_DATE_URL`, `EPIC_FETCH_ALL`), date formats (`DATE_FORMAT`, `DATE_FORMAT_N2`), and API key configuration (`apiKey`).

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for application logic and business rules.
- **Spring Shell**: Enables the creation of interactive command-line applications.
- **Spring Framework with Spring Boot**
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies and lifecycle.
- **Git**: Version control system for collaboration and code management.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains main application code.
  - **com.plenigo.project.command**: Contains `ImageShellCommand`.
  - **com.plenigo.project.service**: Contains `ImageService` and `ImageServiceImpl`.
  - **com.plenigo.project.domain**: Contains `Image` domain object.
  - **com.plenigo.project.config**: Contains `WebConstant` configuration.
 
## Installation
   How to Run
Prerequisites
Before running the NASA EPIC Image Fetcher application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Java: Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher is installed. You can download it from Oracle's website.

Maven: Maven is used for dependency management and building the project. You can download Maven from Maven's official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

I have created a new branch for this task: master so the url of the project on GIT Hub is:
```bash
it should be selected as default but in other case, you need to checkout on master
git checkout master
```

## Getting Started
## 1.Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IM92/plenigo-api-project.git
```
## 2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd project-repository
```
## 3.Building the Project
To build the application, use Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
## 4.Running the Application
To run the NASA EPIC Image Fetcher application, use the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/api.project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Replace api.project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar with the actual name of your JAR file generated by Maven.

## Start testsing the application with Shell commands
## 1.Scenario (Command with two parameters)
Fetching and Saving Images,the command should create a subfolder (of target folder) per date to store images to.
```bash
fetch images 2021-05-18
```
## 2.Scenario (Command with one parameter, date {optional})
```bash
fetch images
```

## Potential Improvements with more time
Given more time, the following improvements could be made to the NASA EPIC Image Fetcher project:

## Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:

Implement more comprehensive error handling to manage edge cases and unexpected errors.
Use a logging framework (such as SLF4J with Logback) to provide detailed logging and tracing capabilities.
## Configuration Management:

Externalize configuration settings (e.g., API keys, URLs, date formats) using Spring Boot's application.properties or application.yml.

## Testing:

Increase test coverage with unit tests and integration tests.
Implement end-to-end testing to ensure the entire workflow operates correctly.

# More advance stuff:
## Dockerization:

Create Dockerfiles to containerize the application, ensuring consistent deployment environments and simplifying deployment.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Travis CI to automate testing and deployment.

## Internationalization (i18n):

Add support for multiple languages to make the application accessible to a wider audience.

## Looking forward for your review and comments about my work!
